# Notebook

### Instructions
The notebook is a running summary of what was done/tried each time you work on the project. If nothing else, a few quick lines and the date.  This may be a Google Doc file, an issue in GitHub, or a markdown file. You may create multiple notebooks, provided they have clear, descriptive names. Insert the link to your notebook below.

In all cases, and in the interest of transparency, a single notebook should be used by all individuals contributing to the project.
