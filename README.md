# Working Memory Error dataset

## Project Goal
Cognitive control plays a crucial role in adaptive behavior and achieving oneâ€™s goals. At the same time, in practice mechanisms of cognitive control never operate alone, rather they are utilized together with other cognitive functions. From behavioral dual-task studies, there is evidence showing different relationships between working memory and speeded conflict task performance when given together, depending on task specifics and stimuli characteristics (Oberauer, 2019; Moss et al., 2020; Muhmenthaler et al., 2023). Additionally, there is data reporting working memory performance impairment specifically related to errors committed in speeded conflict tasks (Wessel et al., 2022). However, neural mechanisms of these interactions as well as direction of these effects remain poorly understood. From a neural perspective, theta oscillations have emerged as a key mediator for both cognitive control processes and working memory (Cavanagh & Frank, 2014; Hsieh & Ranganath, 2014), which offers a potential for further investigation. This work is aimed to investigate relationships between cognitive control processes, such as performance monitoring and conflict processing, and working memory both on behavioral and neural (EEG) levels.
